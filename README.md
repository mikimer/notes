# notes

Mike is having trouble with the mbient labs MetaHub tutorial.

I followed the [MetaHub tutorial](https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/MetaHub.html) and cloned the [JavaScript repo](https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaCloud-SDK-JavaScript). _The only steps that I skipped was [21.1](https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/MetaHub.html#setup-your-hub) since I used the GUI rather than CLI._ I did everything from [21.4.3](https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/MetaHub.html#build-your-own-hub) through the end. In case it matters, I installed `setup_6.x` and not `setup_8.x`. Now I'm getting a `debug` error (below). You can see the [linux details here](https://github.com/mikimer/notes/blob/master/details.md) and a [photo of my setup](https://github.com/mikimer/notes/blob/master/IMG_1393.JPG).

It's now 1.30pm (I emailed Laura at 12noon), I'm still trying to get the MetaHub to work.
I noticed that in the [JavaScript Github README](https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-JavaScript) it says to run `npm install metawear`, but when I do that my [RPi freezes](https://github.com/mikimer/notes/blob/master/IMG_1530.JPG) :(

-----

It's now 2pm. I missed some of the subtleties of the instructions. I added the noble packages. Now I've got progress and new problems :)

It's now 3pm
I'm going to try to use Python instead of JavaScript...
